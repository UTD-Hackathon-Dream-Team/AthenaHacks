      party is coming up soon so I thought I\u2019d come to check up on you as you\u2019re
      bringing the entertainment."

      finding me! I need to grab some more things but I\u2019d love if you could
      leave me some instructions on how to get out?"

    text: "Using an array, you can store each step of how to get out from here. So
      for example you can write [\u201C5 steps right\u201D, \u201C6 steps up\u201D]
      and I\u2019ll use them to get out!"

    text: Thank you so much! Did you know arrays are typically 0th indexed? So to
      access the first element you use arrayName[0] and the second element is arrayName[1].
      Could you tell me what the fifth element would be?

      for your help."
